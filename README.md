## 🚀 About Me

I'm a data scientist with a solid background in time series forecasting, statistical modeling, and machine learning, passionate about building tools that solve real-world problems. My recent work has focused on demand forecasting for retail and supply chain optimization, where I’ve designed scalable forecasting pipelines, led client demos, and created in-house automation tools to improve efficiency.

I'm also deeply interested in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**—especially in using LLMs to improve how people access and understand complex information. My Master's Thesis explored plain language summarization of clinical trials using models like DistilBERT and Mistral-7B.
